Starter

Starter is a starter theme which is intended to pull out all of the javascript and css that Drupal usually imposes, and then
puts in just enough to make it useful.  It was built off of the Drupal theme [mothership](https://drupal.org/project/mothership),
but minus the configuration built into it - the assumption is that you want to remove all the classes unless they're really
necessary.

The assumption is also that you're going to build the js and css out yourself, and that they will be in the public directory in this theme.
